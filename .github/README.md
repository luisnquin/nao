## Configuration

  Nao keeps its configuration file inside of a `nao` directory and the location depends on your operating system. This program leverages [XDG](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) to load its various configurations files. For information on the default locations for your OS please see [this link](https://github.com/adrg/xdg/blob/master/README.md).

# In case an already open note is being called, the program can act in two ways
# 1. Blocking access until the other note is closed
# 2. Opening the note but in read-only mode for the selected editor
#
# The reason for this feature is to avoid overwriting issues
